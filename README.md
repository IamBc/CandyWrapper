<h2>About</h2>
<p>The main purpose of this project was to get familiar with javascript injections. 
While creating this plug-in I created a hero in candy box and since I found myself enjoying the game quite much I decided
to contribute to it through this project.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Insert the javascript from the "install.js" file into a bookmark and activate the bookmark once the candy box website has loaded<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>One click save/load system. Instead of having to write down codes just click on the button. Note: </li>
	<li>Booster packs - Extra candies or a faster candy per second rate with just a click away</li>
	<li>Modes - <b>Fast</b> offering a faster progression, <b>Hard</b> and <b>Very hard</b> offering limited starting candies and limited candy generation</li>
	<li>Booster creator - chose what you need. When you are finished click on it or give it a name and save it to your bookmarks for later.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h2>How to use instructions</h2>
<p>Due to the add on being unoficial my code had to bend to the original design. A few minor issues turned up. Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li>When saving a new character for <b>the first</b>(and only the first) time (meaning a new code) you <b>must save 2 times</b> before the change is final.</li>
<li>When creating your own booster make sure you have bought 1 lollipop, thrown atleast 10 candies and eaten all the candies once. If you try to add resources to something before they have been initialised the effect won't be triggered.</li>
</ul>
