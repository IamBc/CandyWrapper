<h2>About</h2>
<p>The main purpose of this project was to get familiar with javascript injections. 
While creating this plug-in I created a hero in candy box and since I found myself enjoying the game quite much I decided
to contribute to it through this plug-in.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Insert the javascript from the "install.js" file into a bookmark and activate the bookmark once the candy box website has loaded<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>One click save/load system. Instead of having to write down codes just click on the button. Note: When saving a new character for the first time (meaning a new code) you must save 2 times before the change is final</li>
	<li>Booster packs - Extra candies or a faster candy per second rate with just a click away</li>
	<li>Modes - Fast offering a faster progression, Hard and Very hard offering limited starting candies and limited candy generation</li>
	<li>Booster creator - chose what you need. When you are finished click on it or give it a name and save it to your bookmarks for later.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h2>Next version goals</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rework the booster creator</li>
<li>Improve visuals</li>
<li>Add the documentation to the github files</li>
</ul>
